Analyze the Risk-Return Profile
To determine the overall risk of an asset or portfolio, quantitative analysts and investment managers consider not only its risk metrics but also its risk-return profile. After all, if you have two portfolios that each offer a 10% return but one has less risk, you’d probably invest in the smaller-risk portfolio. For this reason, you need to consider the Sharpe ratios for each portfolio.


Diversify the Portfolio
Your analysis is nearing completion. Now, you need to evaluate how the portfolios react relative to the broader market.
